I highly enjoy placing ##
a small amount of ##
margarine on a ##
multigrain cracker. I ##
then add Adams ##
all-natural peanut ##
butter and finalize it ##
with a drop of ##
marmalade to add a ##
sweet touch.§r##
>>>>
I typically have this ##
snack around 6-7 at ##
night on about 10 ##
crackers. I have to ##
make sure the plate is ##
quite flat otherwise ##
the crackers will begin ##
to slide into the middle ##
of the plate when I ##
place specific jams ##
and or jellies on the ##
crackers.§r##
>>>>
This can be quite a ##
concern when making ##
this savoury nosh, so ##
if you are inspired to ##
have some crackers ##
after reading this, ##
please keep this in ##
mind.§r##
